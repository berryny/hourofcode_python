## Commit Using Git

What is [Git](https://git-scm.com/)?

- GIT is not **GitHub**
  - GitHub is just a platform used to save and store your code, and track its versions in a more
    visual way.
- Git is a free and open source distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

### Using Git in Glitch

Open **Terminal**

Terminal **Git** comments

```
git branch
git add .
git commit -m "explain what changes you made as the reasoning for commiting to Github repo"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/cas.git
git push origin master
```

- Username for 'https://github.com': `<username>`
- Password for 'https://berryny@github.com': `<your password>`

### Connect from Desktop to Github

- Create a new repository on the command line

```
echo "# <repo name>" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin master
```

- Push an existing repository from the command line

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Python Language Introduction

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berryny/hourofcode_python/main/python-logo.gif)

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new features, such as list comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting, and was discontinued with version 2.7 in 2020. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
